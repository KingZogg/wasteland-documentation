Create directory on server called "SERVER" in A3Master directory. Make it ALL CAPS .. so you notice it.
You can change the name to anything you like but it's harder for people to spot the subtle changes you are about to make if you call it server.



Only 3 files need to be changed by adding in an extra backslash which allows the files to be found.

IN the PBO you will be making change the following files.
\server\init.sqf
from Line 267 call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "server\missions\setupMissionArrays.sqf";
to Line 267 call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\server\missions\setupMissionArrays.sqf"; //note the extra \     "\server

from Line 356: 	[] execVM "server\missions\masterController.sqf";
to Line 356: 	[] execVM "\server\missions\masterController.sqf";

\server\functions\serverCompile.sqf
from Line 32 mission_VehicleCapture = "server\missions\mainMissions\mission_VehicleCapture.sqf" call mf_compile;
to Line 32 mission_VehicleCapture = "\server\missions\mainMissions\mission_VehicleCapture.sqf" call mf_compile; //note the extra \     "\server


In the missions folder SERVER you created above and which is NOT in pbo format ie: don't pack it. Change the following files.

server\missions\factoryMethods\attemptCompileMissions.sqf
from line 31	missionNamespace setVariable [format ["%1Processor", _x], (format ["server\missions\%1Processor.sqf", _x]) call mf_compile];
to line 31	missionNamespace setVariable [format ["%1Processor", _x], (format ["\server\missions\%1Processor.sqf", _x]) call mf_compile]; //note the extra \     "\server

server\missions\masterController.sqf
from Line 267 call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "server\missions\setupMissionArrays.sqf";
to Line 267 call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\server\missions\setupMissionArrays.sqf"; //note the extra \     "\server


Copy Whole mission directory to the SERVER folder you just made.

PBO the A3Wasteland.Altis file (make sure the mission file has been removed.)
Copy to the server \mpmissions directory.

In the arma3 startups parameters add -mod=SERVER
