Global settings for line endings

The git config core.autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument.

On Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration. For example:

git config --global core.autocrlf true
# Configure Git on Windows to properly handle line endings
You can also provide a special --global flag, which makes Git use the same settings for line endings across every local Git repository on your computer.
